SHEF (VEDA Fork)
================

This ist a fork of the Swing HTML Editor Framework SHEF from soureceforge (http://svn.code.sf.net/p/shef/code)

We need some improvements to the original component to avoid a NullPointerException that occurs in Java 7 when the editor is integrated into an JPanel.
We also need to add German translation for the dialogs shown by the component.

The project page of SHEF can be found on sourceforge http://shef.sourceforge.net/
